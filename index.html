Our vision is an ideal world in which WebRTC application/media servers can be hosted over Kubernetes just like any other workload, and everything works smoothly. Our aim is to create the Kubernetes tooling to allow anyone to deploy a WebRTC backend service over any Kubernetes service, be that hosted or on-prem, and benefit from the same security, scalability and observability features we have come to expect from large-scale cloud native applications."/><link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/logo192.png"/><link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json"/><title>L7mp</title><script id="react-dotenv" src="https://l7mp.io/env.js"></script><script defer="defer" src="/static/js/main.c0c436fb.js"></script><link href="/static/css/main.a7a9dcf9.css" rel="stylesheet"></head><body><noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript><div id="root"></div></body></html>
