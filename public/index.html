      content="L7mp Technologies is a small team of researchers and practitioners working on projects related to integrating real-time communications workloads, especially WebRTC and cloud-gaming, into the cloud native ecosystem. Our vision is an ideal world in which WebRTC application/media servers can be hosted over Kubernetes just like any other workload, and everything works smoothly. Our aim is to create the Kubernetes tooling to allow anyone to deploy a WebRTC backend service over any Kubernetes service, be that hosted or on-prem, and benefit from the same security, scalability and observability features we have come to expect from large-scale cloud native applications."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
