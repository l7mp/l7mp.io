## l7mp: A L7 Multiprotocol Proxy and Service Mesh

L7mp is an experimental Layer-7, multiprotocol service proxy and a service
mesh framework. The emphasis is on multiprotocol support, which lets l7mp to
handle lots of transport- and application-layer network protocols natively,
not just the usual TCP/HTTP, and transparently convert between different
protocol encapsulations. The intention for l7mp is to serve as an incubator
project to prototype the main service mesh features that are indispensable to
support network-intensive legacy/non-HTTP applications seamlessly in
Kubernetes.
